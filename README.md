# Duckyspark v.0.33

Translator from USB-Rubber-Ducky payloads (Ducky script) to a Digispark code.


# Usage:

    python3 Duckyspark_translator.py [payload.txt] [output_file]

### or

    python3 Duckyspark_translator.py [payload.txt]
###### in this case the translated payload will be saved in the file "digipayload.ino"


Ducky payloads you can find here:   https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads

Or, you can simply write your own payloads using Ducky script

Ducky script syntax:                https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript

Recently we found the video "Digispark Flashing Guide & Ducky Payload Converters" that shows how to flash Digispark using the payloads generated by our script:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrn_hgckhGw&lc
